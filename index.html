          <ul class="ul_care_tips">
            <li class="care_tip">Clean the tank often.</li>
            <li class="care_tip">Change the water sometimes, but not too frequently.</li>
            <li class="care_tip">Change the filter regularly.</li>
            <li class="care_tips">Approximately one pound of live rock per gallon of water is required. </li>
            <li class="care_tips">A hang-on-the-back protein skimmer should be operating as soon as the live rock is introduced. Protein skimming is an area where the hobbyist can virtually spend as much as he/she wants without necessarily having increased the efficiency of the system. When making this decision, be aware that some skimming is better than none.</li>
            <li class="care_tips">Incidental equipment should include a high quality heater (preferably submersible), digital thermometer, saltwater test kits to include pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and calcium, a hydrometer, pH buffer, calcium, a coral "conditioner" of choice and dechlorinator.</li>
            <li class="care_tip">Do not attempt to walk your fish on a leash.</li>
            <li class="care_tip">Avoid lengthy monologues about your fish collection in social settings. I assure you no one wants to hear about your fish, sir.</li>
            <li class="care_tip">If arrested on suspicion of grand theft for your <i>alleged</i> involvement in a koi fish heist, remember that you have the right to an attorney, and to remain silent.</li>
